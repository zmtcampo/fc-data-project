# County Dashboard Project

## Project Overview

This R Shiny dashboard offers a comprehensive platform to analyze trends in traffic congestion and system reliability from 2018-2020, including metrics such as BTI, TTI, PTI, severity, and variability. It also examines shifts in environmental justice populations between 2013 and 2022, focusing on demographics like poverty, disability, limited car access, elderly, young, and limited English proficiency. By integrating census and traffic data, the dashboard provides insights into how congestion and reliability issues impact environmental justice communities, highlighting areas of concern and informing policy decisions to promote equity and reduce disparities. Users can explore temporal trends, comparative analysis, and correlations to better understand the complex relationships between traffic patterns and community characteristics.

Attached are static snapshots of the dashboard, showing Congestion, Reliability, and Environmental Justice. For the full interactive experience, access the live version [here](https://r0nitz-sarki.shinyapps.io/dash_arc_deploy/) and code [here](https://github.com/zmtcampo/fc_data_project_r).
